# Wealth Engine
A browser-based personal wealth forecasting app built with React, Vite and Tailwind CSS. The project runs automatically on StackBlitz, letting you model multiple investment scenarios to visualise projected net worth over time.

Use the scenario toggle to switch between Base, Aggressive and Conservative assumptions. A dark mode switch in the top right lets you change themes.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

To generate a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
